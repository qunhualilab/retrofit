Description: RETROFIT is a Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization framework 
    to decompose cell type mixtures in ST data without using external single-cell 
    expression references. RETROFIT outperforms existing reference-based methods 
    in estimating cell type proportions and reconstructing gene expressions in 
    simulations with varying spot size and sample heterogeneity, irrespective of the 
    quality or availability of the single-cell reference. RETROFIT recapitulates 
    known cell-type localization patterns in a Slide-seq dataset of mouse cerebellum 
    without using any single-cell data.
